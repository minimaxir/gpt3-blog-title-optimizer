# GPT-3 Blog Title Optimizer

Python code for building a GPT-3 based technical blog post optimizer, given that the user provides their own OpenAI keys and resources.

The Notebooks provided here are a proof-of-concept: to use them for yourself, you will need to finetune your own GPT-3 model as noted in my blog post.

# App Review Compliance

This repo is released under the [Open-source / Bring-Your-Own-Key applications](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines/open-source-bring-your-own-key-applications) provision of OpenAI's usage guidelines as the constraints make the results neither high-stakes nor disallowed.

Since the Notebook is intended to be used on an _ad hoc_, non-recurring basis, it does not fall into the [provision of requiring to submit an app review](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines/who-is-required-to-submit-an-app-review). (if OpenAI disagrees, feel free to contact me)
